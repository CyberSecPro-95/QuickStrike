> A hybrid offensive security framework that combines modern API vulnerability detection with classic web application testing for comprehensive security assessments.

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch

QuickStrike is an advanced offensive security framework designed for modern penetration testing and bug bounty programs. It seamlessly integrates API endpoint discovery, authentication bypass testing, IDOR detection, and classic web vulnerability scanning into a unified, high-performance scanning engine.

## ✨ Features

- 🛡️ **Input Sanitization** - Prevents injection attacks with comprehensive validation
- 🏎️ **Adaptive Throttling** - Intelligent rate limiting to avoid detection
- 🔍 **IDOR Detection** - Advanced insecure direct object reference testing
- 🚀 **API Discovery** - Automated endpoint enumeration and validation
- 🔓 **Auth Bypass** - Multi-vector authentication testing
- 🎭 **Token Leakage** - Comprehensive token and session exposure detection
- ⚡ **Classic Web Vulns** - SQLi, XSS, and legacy vulnerability scanning
- 📊 **Professional Reporting** - JSON, Markdown, and PDF output formats
- 🔄 **Escalation Engine** - Automatic attack surface expansion
- 🛑 **Hard Kill** - Immediate shutdown capability for operational security

## 🔒 Responsible Disclosure

QuickStrike is designed **exclusively for authorized security testing**. Users must have explicit permission to test target systems. This tool adheres to industry-standard bug bounty ethics and responsible disclosure practices. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may violate applicable laws.
